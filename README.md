### Background
I've been coding since I was eight by developing simple Arduino scripts. 

During high school, I learned to develop in Java, Python, Flutter, and C++. 

I am now a CECS student and am interested in AI, ML, and computer vision.

## Experience
I was the programming leader in the FRC LBL 7403 team in 2024, but I was a member from 2019 to 2024

Led a team of fellow students and programmers in creating an internal management solution for the Club Campestre Foundation
which could help give out scholarships and maintain benefactors in good standing with the foundation.

I was part of TOM Medellin from 2022 to 2024, where I participated as a Maker and was the systems leader. There we developed
a smart cane that could detect objects up to 6 meters away and warn the user, and a WhatsApp chatbot that interacted with potential customers for
a group of local farmers.

I also created an internal management solution for TOM Medellin 2022, which helped track social hours for more than 100 makers.

I went to the Harvard pre-college program in summer 2023, where I created an image classification model with over 94% accuracy
for the CIFAR-10 database and the MNIST database.

In spring 2025, I developed an interactive game that allowed children to learn about the impact of wildfires on climate change using
Python and Arduino.

Currently, I am leading a small team in the development of smart glasses that can detect intentional blinks and run macros accordingly.

During June to August of this year, I will be back in Colombia working as a part-time software developer for the company PACO:
